# Hello there!

I am a student interested in DevOps and backend.

mainly use Python and I am interested in async.

For libraries I use often, I use micro frameworks like sanic and flask.

Other than that, I use aiohttp, beautifulsoup4, and discord.py.

I am currently studying JavaScript because I am interested in the front end and JavaScript.

I want to study Kotlin as well if I have the chance.
